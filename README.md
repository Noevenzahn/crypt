# PWA to keep an eye on the crypto market

Utilizing the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/), React, local storage, and a service worker, I've made a mobile-focused PWA.

It was the first project with API calls depending and changing on user input that I created. I learned a lot while writing the code because I did it without a tutorial or course (but of course Google and StackOverflow helped as usual).
